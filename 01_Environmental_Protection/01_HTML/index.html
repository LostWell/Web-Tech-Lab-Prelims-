			<h2> Strict Trash Collection </h2>
        	<p> In South Sanitary Camp, residents are strictly advised to bring their trashed to their designated trash collection areas every Tuesday, on or before 7:00 in the morning. There are volunteers manning the designated areas to prevent people from dumping their trash after seven A.M.. Dump trucks usually arrive before 7:30 and before they arrive, the trash are being segragated and organized for easier collection. This is the reason why the community is advised to bring their trash to the designated collection areas on or before 7:00 A.M..

        	<h2>"Tapat ko, Linis ko"</h2>
        	<p> The word "sanitary", according to google, is relating to the conditions that affect hygiene and health. So if you're someone who is not a resident of Sanitary Camp, you'd expect the barangay to be very clean. The people of South Sanitary Camp are expected to clean after themselves. Residents are expected to clean around the premises of their households to maintain the cleanliness of the community. Although people don't get fined when they don't clean their area, still, everyone in the community cooperates in keeping the barangay clean.
