		<h1>Environmental Protection</h1>
        <p>The pips of sanitary camp are monitored by an alien race to make sure that they maintain the cleanliness of the environment. These aliens were hired by the local government since they have arrived at the conclusion that regular Earth weapons did not seem fitting for the on going riots and destruction of mother nature. It was a long pointless battle that the citizens had to endure, but thanks to the outside help. The barangay was restored to its former glory.</p>
        <p> The citizens enjoyed a prosperous time. This was even considered as the golden age of sanitary camp. Little did they know that in an obvious plot twist the aliens would turn on them. At the start, the aliens had mild control over the government but soon after they have completely overthrown them. The aliens realized that the humans were resilient.</p>
