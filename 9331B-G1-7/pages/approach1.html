				<p>To understand what equality means, the first thing we need to understand would be the word 'equal'. Equal means having a like in quality, nature or status. It also means having a like for each memember of a group, class or society.(Merriam-Webster)

				Equality is usually perceived as sameness, identical, identity. So what is equality, it simply means 'similarity' now a group of different persons can have the same qualities, it cannot be in all respects but at least just one. Let us say they have similarity on one specific feature but it has differences on other features. An example would be that men are equal but we cannot say that they are identical. 
				Equality simply asks one question and that "Equal in what respect?"

				Equality also means that every individual is given an equal oppurtunity.
