			<div class="article-main">
				<p>Everyone has rights, men and women. It is just a matter of how you use that rights of yours. Where should we start? We should start with the law. 

				"The law is a statement of your worth by your government. Laws that treat men and women, girls and boys unequally relegate women and girls to lower a status in society Failure to outlaw practices that harm women and girls leaves them no recourse for violations against them. The law is the way to hold your government accountable for your protection."
