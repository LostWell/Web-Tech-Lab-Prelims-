				<p>Gender Equality is a fundamental human rights and that in all sectors of society, men and women should enjoy same rights and oppurtunities. It is a necessary foundation of a peaceful, prosperous, sustainable world.Throughout the years, gender equality has been a sensitive issue but under the millennuim development, it has then made such progress but the fight for discrimination should still continue. 

				With such progress, fewer oppurtunities are still given to women than men when it comes to economic development and that is a fact. 
				WHile gender equality and its principle to participate in the workplace is generally accepted, it is also important to have an open and friendly atmosphere towards gender discrimination issues or discussions. 

				Promoting gender equality also means having a platform that empowers women and girls. Having a good practice and sharing of evidence and experiences to be able to reach their full economic potential not only for women but also for men. An oppurtunity to become a leader of a community, to be an advocate and be a change makers.</p>
