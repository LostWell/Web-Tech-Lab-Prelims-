			<h1>What is Equality</h1>
			<p>
				To understand what equality means, the first thing we need to understand would be the word 'equal'. Equal means having a like in quality, nature or status. It also means having a like for each memember of a group, class or society.(Merriam-Webster)

				Equality is usually perceived as sameness, identical, identity. So what is equality, it simply means 'similarity' now a group of different persons can have the same qualities, it cannot be in all respects but at least just one. Let us say they have similarity on one specific feature but it has differences on other features. An example would be that men are equal but we cannot say that they are identical. 
				Equality simply asks one question and that "Equal in what respect?"

				Equality also means that every individual is given an equal oppurtunity.

			<h1>Why Equality is Important</h1>
			<p>
				Equality makes a society fair to each member of their community. Generalizations about a particular group are not allowed and it also prevents any section of the society to dominate each other. Equality also makes you realize that there are some people who needs more support than others do in order for them to recognize or achieve their full potential.

			<h1>Why Gender Equality</h1>
			<p>
				Gender Equality is a fundamental human rights and that in all sectors of society, men and women should enjoy same rights and oppurtunities. It is a necessary foundation of a peaceful, prosperous, sustainable world.Throughout the years, gender equality has been a sensitive issue but under the millennuim development, it has then made such progress but the fight for discrimination should still continue. 

				With such progress, fewer oppurtunities are still given to women than men when it comes to economic development and that is a fact. 
				WHile gender equality and its principle to participate in the workplace is generally accepted, it is also important to have an open and friendly atmosphere towards gender discrimination issues or discussions. 

				Promoting gender equality also means having a platform that empowers women and girls. Having a good practice and sharing of evidence and experiences to be able to reach their full economic potential not only for women but also for men. An oppurtunity to become a leader of a community, to be an advocate and be a change makers.

			<h1>How can Equality be a Reality</h1>
			<p>
				Everyone has rights, men and women. It is just a matter of how you use that rights of yours. Where should we start? We should start with the law. 

				"The law is a statement of your worth by your government. Laws that treat men and women, girls and boys unequally relegate women and girls to lower a status in society Failure to outlaw practices that harm women and girls leaves them no recourse for violations against them. The law is the way to hold your government accountable for your protection."
